##   company = col_character(),
##   `Product code / number` = col_character(),
##   address = col_character(),
##   city = col_character(),
##   country = col_character(),

## )
```

####Lowered cased all data in under company column

```r

library(tidyr)
mydata <- separate(refine_original,
                   col = "Product code / number",
                   into = c("Product code", "Product Name"), 
                   sep = "-")
