###Import Data
Imported data into R Studio and changed file to "refine_orginial" and saved as a csv file.

### Lowered case for all variables in Company column
```{r}
refine_original$company <- tolower(refine_original$company)

```

### Seperated column Product code/number into two seperate columns
```{r}
library(tidyr)
mydata <- separate(refine_original,
                   col = "Product code / number",
                   into = c("Product code", "Product Name"), 
                   sep = "-")
```

### 
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
